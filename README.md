PHR Vault is a decentralized, blockchain-powered Personal Health Record (PHR) system that gives patients **full control over their health data** with strong guarantees of privacy, transparency, and security.  
This prototype demonstrates how Web3 technologies (Solidity, IPFS, Smart Contracts) can redefine digital health and support patient-centric ecosystems.
